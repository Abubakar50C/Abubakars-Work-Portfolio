# module-02-Challenge

## This is a working portfolio of my work to be eventually presented to potential employers.

-My motivation to create this project is because this is really the first of my projects that an employer will see, so you cna imagine the immportance.
-I buult this project in order to give myself some practical and real life understanding of how to create a simple web page and style it.
-This web page solves the problem of potential future employers having to go through a hassle to view my projects and work. I think this is a very practical project.
-Throughout the making of this web page I've learned the importance of trial and error and esepcially debugging when it coems to writing your own code from scratch.
